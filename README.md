# Fetch-API
This project is for practicing API. In this project, I have defined 5 buttons and 1 form. You can read a .txt file, .json file, get albums data from {JSON} Placeholder or
get posts data from {JSON} Placeholder by clicking button. Also, you can make POST request to add post and get the response through console.

## How to run
1. Clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/SakibAlEmran/Fetch-API.git
```
2. Open index.html in browser, click buttons and test the result.
3. Open the console to check the errors or post request response.
